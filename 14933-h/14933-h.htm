<h2>THE GREAT CREATURE.</h2>
<p>Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk was a tall young man, a thin
young man, a pale young man, and, as some of his friends asserted,
a decidedly knock-kneed young man. Moreover he was a young man
belonging to and connected with the highly respectable firm of
Messrs. Tims and Swindle, attorneys and bill-discounters, of
Thavies&rsquo;-inn, Holborn; from the which highly respectable firm
Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk received a salary of one pound one
shilling per week, in requital for his manifold services. The
vocation in which Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk laboured partook
peculiarly of the peripatetic; for at all sorts of hours, and
through all sorts of streets was Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk
daily accustomed to transport his anatomy&mdash;presenting overdue
bills, inquiring after absent acceptors, invisible indorsers, and
departed drawers, for his masters, and wearing out, as he Mr.
Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk eloquently expressed it, &ldquo;no end
of boots for himself.&rdquo; Such was the occupation by which Mr.
Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk lived; but such was not the peculiar
path to fame for which his soul longed. No! &ldquo;he had seen
plays, and longed to blaze upon the stage a star of
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That portion of time which was facetiously called by Messrs.
Tims and Swindle &ldquo;the leisure&rdquo; of Mr. Horatio
Fitzharding Fitzfunk, being some eight hours out of the
twenty-four, was spent in poring over the glorious pages of the
immortal bard; and in the desperate enthusiasm of his heated genius
would he, Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk, suddenly burst forth in
some of the most exciting passages, and with Stentorian lungs
&ldquo;render night hideous&rdquo; to the startled inhabitant of
the one-pair-back, adjoining the receptacle of his own truckle-bed
and mortal frame.</p>
<p>Luck, whether good or evil, begat Mr. Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk an introduction to some other talented young gentlemen,
who had so far progressed in histrionic acquirements, that from
spouting themselves, they had taken to spouting their watches, and
other stray articles of small value, to enable them to pay the
charges of a private theatre, where, as often as they could raise
the needful, they astonished and delighted their wondering friends.
Among this worshipful society was Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk
adopted and enrolled as a trusty and well-beloved member; and in
the above-named private theatre, in suit of solemn black, slightly
relieved by an enormous white handkerchief, and a well-chalked
countenance, did Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk, at or about the
hour of half past eight&mdash;being precisely sixty minutes behind
the period announced, in consequence of the non-arrival of the one
fiddle and ditto flute comprising, or rather that ought to have
comprised, the orchestra&mdash;made his d&eacute;but, and a
particularly nervous bow to the good folks there assembled,
&ldquo;as and for&rdquo; the character &ldquo;of Hamlet, the Danish
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To describe the &ldquo;exclamations of delight,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;tornadoes of applause,&rdquo; the earthquakes of rapture, or
the &ldquo;breathless breathing&rdquo; of the entranced audience,
would beat Mr. Bunn into fits, and the German company into
fiddle-cases; so, like a newspaper legacy, which is the only one
that never pays duty, we &ldquo;<em>leave</em> it to our
reader&rsquo;s imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The die was cast. Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk&rsquo;s
former avocations became intensely irksome&mdash;if he served a
writ it was no longer a &ldquo;writ of right.&rdquo; Copies for
&ldquo;Jenkins&rdquo; were consigned to &ldquo;Tompkins;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Brown&rdquo; declined pleading to &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; and
Smith declared off Brown&rsquo;s declaration. In inquiries after
&ldquo;solvent acceptors,&rdquo; Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk
was still more abroad. In the mystification of his brains, all
answers seemed to be delivered &ldquo;per contra.&rdquo; Forlorn
hopes on three-and sixpenny stamps were converted into the
circulating medium; &ldquo;good actors&rdquo; were considered
&ldquo;good men&rdquo; in the very reverse of Shylock&rsquo;s
acceptation of the term; and astonished indorsers succeeded in
&ldquo;raising the wind&rdquo; upon &ldquo;kites&rdquo; they would
have bet any odds no &ldquo;wind in the world could induce to
fly.&rdquo; Everything in this world must come to an
end&mdash;bills generally do in three months: so did these, and so
did Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk&rsquo;s responsible and
peripatetic avocations in the highly respectable firm of Messrs.
Tims and Swindle, attorneys, and to their cost, through the agency
of Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk, bill-discounters, of
Thavies&rsquo; Inn, Holborn; they, the said highly respectable firm
of Tims and Swindle, handing over to Mr. Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk the sum of four and tenpence, being the balance of his
quarter&rsquo;s salary, which, so great was Mr. Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk&rsquo;s opinion of the solvency of the said highly
respectable firm, he had allowed to remain undrawn in their hands,
together with a note utterly and totally declining any further
service or assistance as &ldquo;<em>in</em>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<em>out</em>door&rdquo; or any sort of clerk at all, from
Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk, and amiably recommending the said
Horatio to apply elsewhere for a character; the which advice Mr.
Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk attended to instanter, and received,
in consideration of the sum of thirty shillings, that of
&ldquo;Richard the Third&rdquo; from the Dramatic Committee of
Catherine Street. If Hamlet was good, Richard (among the amateurs)
was better; and if Richard was better, Shylock (at &ldquo;one
five&rdquo;) was best, and Romeo and all the rest better still: and
it may be worthy of remark, that there is no person on earth looked
upon by admiring managers as more certain of success than the
&ldquo;promising young man who PAYS for his parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it so happened that Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk&rsquo;s
purse became an exceedingly &ldquo;Iago&rdquo;-like,
&ldquo;something, nothing, trashy&rdquo; sort of affair&mdash;in
other words, that its owner, Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk, was
regularly stumped; and as the Amateur Dramatic Theatrical Committee
&ldquo;always go upon the <em>no pay no play system</em>,&rdquo;
Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk was about to incur the fate of
Lord John Russell&rsquo;s tragedy, and become regularly
&ldquo;shelved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this dilemma Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk addressed all
sorts of letters to all sorts of managers, offering himself for all
sorts of salaries, to play the best of all sorts of business, but
never received any sort of answer from one of them! Returning to
his solitary lodging, after a fortnight&rsquo;s &ldquo;half and
half&rdquo; of patience and despair, and just as despair was
walking poor patience to Old Harry, Mr. Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk encountered one of his histrionic acquaintance, who did
the &ldquo;three and sixpenny walking gents,&rdquo; and dramatic
general postmen, or letter-deliverers, at &ldquo;the
Private.&rdquo; In the course of the enlightened conversation
between the said friend, Mr. Julius Dilberry Pipps, and Mr. Horatio
Fitzharding Fitzfunk, Julius Dilberry Pipps expressed an earnest
wish that he &ldquo;might be blowed considerably tighter than the
Vauxhall balloon if ever he <em>see</em> such a likeness of Mr.
Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam,&rdquo; the &ldquo;great actor of
the day,&rdquo; as his &ldquo;<em>bussom</em> and intimate,&rdquo;
Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk! A nervous pressure of Mr. Horatio
Fitzharding Fitzfunk&rsquo;s &ldquo;pickers and stealers&rdquo;
having nearly reduced to one vast chaos the severely compressed
digits of the enthusiastic Julius Dilberry Pipps, the invisible
green broad-cloth envelopments and drab lower encasements, crowned
with gossamer and based with calf-skin, wherein the total outward
man of Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk was enrobed, together with
his ambulating anatomy, evanished from the startled gaze of the
deserted and finger-contused Julius Dilberry Pipps! Having asserted
the entire realisation of his hastily-formed wish, in the emphatic
words, &ldquo;Well, I <em>am</em> blowed!&rdquo; and a further
comment, stating his conviction that &ldquo;this was
<em>rayther</em> a rummy go,&rdquo; Mr. Julius Dilberry Pipps
reduced his exchequer the gross amount of threepence, paid in
consideration of the instant receipt of &ldquo;a pint
o&rsquo;porter and screw,&rdquo; to the fumigation of which he
applied with such excessive vigour, that in a few moments he might
be said, by his own exertions in &ldquo;blowing a cloud,&rdquo; to
be corporeally as well as mentally &ldquo;in nubibus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To account for the rapid departure of Mr. Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk, we must inform our readers the supposed similarity
alluded to by Julius Dilberry Pipps, between the &ldquo;great
creature,&rdquo; Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam, and Horatio
Fitzharding Fitzfunk, had been before frequently insisted upon: and
this assertion of the obtuse Julius Dilberry Pipps now seemed
&ldquo;confirmation strong as proof of holy writ.&rdquo; Agitated
with conflicting emotions, and regardless of small children and
apple-stalls, Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk rushed on with
headlong speed, every now and then ejaculating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do it, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; A sudden overhauling of his pockets
produced some stray halfpence; master of a &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
head,&rdquo; a sheet of vellum, a new &ldquo;Mordaunt,&rdquo; and
an &ldquo;envelope,&rdquo; Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk,
arrived at his three-pair-back, indited an epistle to the manager
at the town of &mdash;&mdash;, with extraordinary haste signed the
document, and, in &ldquo;the hurry of the moment,&rdquo; left the
inscription thus&mdash;H.F. FITZFLAM! The morrow&rsquo;s post
brought an answer; the terms were acceded to, the night appointed
for his opening; and Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk found, upon
inspecting the proof of the playbill, the name in full of
&ldquo;<em>Mr. Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam</em>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the great tragedian of the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pass we over the intervening space, and at once come to the
momentous morning of rehearsal. The expected Roscius arrived like
punctuality&rsquo;s self, at the appointed minute, was duly
received by the company, who had previously been canvassing his
merits, and assuring each other that all stars were <em>muffs</em>,
but Fitzflam one of the most impudent impostors that ever moved.
&ldquo;I, sir,&rdquo; said the leader of the discontented
fifteen-shillings-a-week-when-they-could-get-it squad, &ldquo;I
have been in the <em>profession</em> more years than this fellow
has months, and he is getting hundreds where I am neglected: never
mind! only give me a chance, and I&rsquo;ll show him up. But I
suppose the management&mdash;(pretty management, to engage such a
chap when I&rsquo;m here)&mdash;I suppose they will truckle to him,
and send me on, as usual, for some wretched old bloke there&rsquo;s
no getting a hand in. John Kemble himself (and I&rsquo;m told
I&rsquo;m in his style), I say, John Kemble, my prototype, the now
immortal John, never got applause in
&lsquo;<em>Blokes!</em>&lsquo;&mdash;But never mind.&rdquo; As a
genealogist would say, &ldquo;Fitz the son of Funk&rdquo; never
more truly represented his ancestral cognomen than on this trying
occasion. He was no longer with amateurs, but
regulars,&mdash;fellows that could &ldquo;talk and get on
somehow;&rdquo; that were never known to stick in Richard, when
they remembered a speech from George Barnwell; men with
&ldquo;swallows&rdquo; like Thames tunnels: in fact, accomplished
&ldquo;gaggers&rdquo; and unrivalled &ldquo;wing watchers.&rdquo;
However, as Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk spoke to none of them,
crossed where he liked, cut out most of <em>their</em> best
speeches, and turned <em>all</em> their <em>backs</em> to the
audience, he passed muster exceedingly well, and acted the genuine
star with considerable effect. So it was at night. Some folks
objected to his knees, to be sure; but then they were
silenced&mdash;&ldquo;What! Fitzflam&rsquo;s knees bad! Nonsense!
Fitzflam is the thing in London; and do you think Fitzflam ought to
be decried in the provinces? hasn&rsquo;t he been lithographed by
Lane? Pooh! impudence! spite!&rdquo; The great <em>name</em> made
Mr. Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk &ldquo;the great man,&rdquo; and
all went swimmingly. On the last night of his engagement, the night
devoted to his benefit, the house was crammed, and Mr. <span class=

Fitzharding Fitzfunk, reflecting that all was &ldquo;cock
sure,&rdquo; as he should pocket the proceeds and return to London
undiscovered, was elevated to Mahomet&rsquo;s seventh heaven of
happiness, awaiting with impatience the prompter&rsquo;s whistle
and the raising of the curtain: where for a time we will leave him,
and attend upon the real &ldquo;Simon Pure&rdquo;&mdash;the genuine
and &ldquo;old original Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO THE GENERAL
DISTRESS.</h2>
<h4>I.&mdash;<em>Copy of a Letter from the Under Secretary of State
to Punch.</em></h4>
<p class="rgt">Downing-street.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Knowing that you are everywhere, the Secretary of
State has desired me to request you will inquire into the alleged
distress, and particularly into the fact of people who it is
alleged are so unreasonable in their expectations of food, as to
die because they cannot get any.</p>
<p class="rgt">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.<br />
HORATIO FITZ-SPOONY</p>
<h4>II.&mdash;<em>Copy of Punch&rsquo;s Letter to the Under
Secretary of State.</em></h4>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I have received your note. I am everywhere; but as
everything is gay when I make my appearance, I have not seen much
of the distress you speak of. I shall, however, make it my business
to look the subject up, and will convey my report to the
Government.</p>
<p class="rgt">I think it no honour to be yours, &amp;c.; but<br />
I have the very great honour to be myself without any &amp;c.<br />
PUNCH.</p>
<p>In compliance with the above correspondence, Punch proceeded to
make the necessary inquiries, and very soon was enabled to forward
the following</p>
<h3>REPORT ON THE PUBLIC DISTRESS.</h3>
<h4><em>To Her Majesty&rsquo;s Secretary of State for the Home
Department.</em></h4>
<p>Sir,&mdash;In compliance with my undertaking to inquire into the
public distress, I went into the manufacturing districts, where I
had heard that several families were living in one room with
nothing to eat, and no bed to lie upon. Now, though it is true that
there are in some places as many as thirty people in one apartment,
I do not think their case very distressing, because, at all events,
they have the advantage of society, which could not be the case if
they were residing in separate apartments. It is clear that their
living together must be a matter of choice, because I found in the
same town several extensive mansions inhabited by one or two people
and a few servants; and there are also some hundreds of houses
wholly untenanted. Now, if we multiply the houses by the rooms in
them, and then divide by the number of the population, we should
find that there will be an average of three attics and
two-sitting-rooms for each family of five persons, or an attic and
a half with one parlour for every two and a half individuals; and
though one person and a half would find it inconvenient to occupy a
sleeping room and three-quarters, I think my calculation will show
you that the accounts of the insufficiency of lodging are gross and
wicked exaggerations, only spread by designing persons to embarrass
the Government.</p>
<p>With regard to the starvation part of the question, I have made
every possible inquiry, and it is true that several people have
died because they would not eat food; for the facts I shall bring
to your notice will prove that no one can have perished from the
<em>want</em> of it. Now, after visiting a family, which I was told
were in a famishing state, what was my surprise to observe a
baker&rsquo;s shop exactly opposite their lodging, whilst a short
way down the street there was a butcher&rsquo;s also! The family
consisted of a husband and wife, four girls, eight boys, and an
infant of three weeks old, making in all fifteen individuals. They
told me they were literally dying of hunger, and that they had
applied to the vestry, who had referred them to the guardians, who
had referred them to the overseer, who had referred them to the
relieving officer, who had gone out of town, and would be back in a
week or two. Not even supposing there were a brief delay in
attending to their case, at least by the proper authorities, you
will perceive that I have already alluded to a baker&rsquo;s and a
butcher&rsquo;s, <em>both</em> (it will scarcely be believed at the
Home-office) in the <em>very street</em> the family were residing
in. Being determined to judge for myself, I counted personally the
number of four-pound loaves in the baker&rsquo;s window, which
amounted to thirty-six, while there were twenty-five two-pound
loaves on the shelves, to say nothing of fancy-bread and flour
<em>ad libitum</em>. But let us take the loaves alone,</p>
<table summary="Loaf count" style="margin:auto">
<tr>

<td style="text-align:right">36</td>

<td style="text-align:right">194</td>
<td>pounds of good wholesome bread,</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>which, if divided amongst a family of fifteen, would give 12
pounds and 14 fractions of a pound to each individual. Knocking off
the baby, for the sake of uniformity, and striking out the mother,
both of whom might be supposed to take the fancy bread and the
flour, which I have not included in my calculation, and in order to
get even numbers, supposing that 194 pounds of bread might become
195 pounds by over weight, we should get the enormous quantity of
fifteen full pounds weight of bread, or a stone and one-fourteenth,
(more, positively, than anybody ought to eat), for the husband and
each of the children (except the baby, who gets a moiety of the
rolls) belonging to this <em>starving family</em>!!! You will see,
Sir, how shamefully matters have been misrepresented by the
Anti-Corn-Law demagogues; but let us now come to the
butcher&rsquo;s meat.</p>
<p>It will hardly be credited that I counted no less than fourteen
sheep hanging up in the shop I have alluded to, while there was a
bullock being skinned in the back yard, and a countless quantity of
liver and lights all over the premises. Knocking off the infant
again for the sake of uniformity, you will perceive that the
fourteen sheep would be one sheep each for every member of this
family, including the mother, to whom we gave half the rolls and
flour in the former case, and there still remains (to say nothing
of the entire bullock for the baby of three weeks, which no one
will deny to be sufficient) a large quantity of lights, et cetera,
for the cat or dog, if there should be such a wilful extravagance
in the family. With these facts I close my report, and I trust that
you will see how thoroughly I have proved the assertion of the Duke
of Wellington&mdash;that if there is distress, it must be in some
way quite unconnected with a want of food, for there is plenty to
eat in every part of the country.</p>
<p>I shall be happy to undertake further inquiries, and shall have
no objection to consider myself regularly under Government.</p>
<p class="rgt">Yours obediently,<br />
PUNCH.</p>

<h3>THE TEA SERVICE ON SEA SERVICE.</h3>

<span class="hide">S</span>imultaneously with the last chord of the
last quadrille the important announcement was made that supper was
ready&mdash;a piece of information that produced a visible
commotion among the party. Young gentlemen who had incautiously
engaged old or ugly partners evinced a decided desire to get rid of
them, or, by the expression of their countenances, seemed to be
inwardly cursing their unfortunate situation. Young ladies in whose
bosoms the first &ldquo;slight predilection&rdquo; had taken up a
residence, experienced, they knew not why, a mental and physical
prostration at the absence of Orlando Sims or Tom Walker, who (how
provoking!) were doing the gallant to some &ldquo;horrid
disagreeable coquettes.&rdquo; Mamas, who really did like a good
supper, and considered it an integral portion of their daily
sustenance, crowded towards the door that led to the comestibles,
fearing that they might not get eligible situations before the
solids, but be placed among the bashful young gentlemen, who linger
to the last to pull off their gloves in order to pull them on
again, and look as though they considered they ought to be happy
and were extremely surprised that they were not.
<p>The arrangement of the supper-table displayed the deep research
of Mesdames Applebite and Waddledot in the mysteries of
gastronomical architecture. Pagodas of barley-sugar glistened in
the rays of thirty-six wax candles and four Argand
lamps&mdash;parterres of jellies, gravelled round with ratafias or
valanced with lemon-peel, trembled as though in sympathy with the
agitated bosoms of their delicate concocters&mdash;custards
freckled with nutmeg clustered the crystal handles of their cups
together&mdash;sarcophagi of pound cakes frowned, as it were, upon
the sweetness which surrounded them&mdash;whilst fawn-coloured
elephants (from the confectionary menagerie of the celebrated
Simpson of the Strand) stood ready to be slaughtered. Huge
stratified pies courted the inquiries of appetite. Chickens boiled
and roast reposed on biers of blue china bedecked with sprigs of
green parsley and slices of yellow lemon. Tanks of golden sherry
and</p>

<p>FULL-BODIED PORTE</p>
</div>
<p>wooed the thirsty revellers; and never since the unlucky dessert
of Mother Eve have temptations been so willingly embraced. The
carnage commenced&mdash;spoons dived into the jelly&mdash;knives
lacerated the poultry and the raised pies&mdash;a colony of
custards vanished in a moment&mdash;the elephants were demolished
by &ldquo;ivories<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1.
<em>Anglic&egrave;</em>, Teeth.&mdash;THE <em>one</em>
PIERCE.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the sarcophagi were buried&mdash;and
the glittering pagodas melted rapidly before the heat and the
attacks of four little ladies in white muslin and pink sashes. The
tanks of sherry and port were distributed by the young gentlemen
into the glasses and over the dresses of the young ladies. The
tipsy-cake, like the wreck of the <em>Royal George</em>, was
rescued from the foaming ocean in which it had been imbedded. The
diffident young gentlemen grew very red about the eyes, and very
loquacious about the &ldquo;next set after supper;&rdquo; whilst
the faces of the elderly ladies all over lie room looked like the
red lamps on Westminster Bridge, and ought to have been beacons to
warn the inexperienced that where they shone there was very little
water. The violent clattering of the plates was at length succeeded
by a succession of merry giggles and provoking little screams,
occasioned by the rapid discharge of a park of
<em>bonbons</em>.</p>
<p>Where the &ldquo;slight predilection&rdquo; was reciprocated,
the Orlando Simses and the Tom Walkers were squeezing in beside the
blushing idols of their worship and circling the waists of their
divinities with their arms, in order to take up less room on the
rout-stool.</p>
<p>Mamas were shaking heads at daughters who had ventured upon a
tenth sip of a glass of sherry. Papas were getting extremely
jocular about the probability of becoming grand-dittos. Everybody
else was doing exactly what everybody pleased, when Mrs.
Applebite&rsquo;s uncle John emerged from behind an epergne, and
vociferously commanded everybody to charge their glasses; a
requisition which nobody was bold enough to dispute. Uncle John
then wiped his lips in the table-cloth, and proceeded to inform the
company of a fact that was universally understood, that they had
met there to celebrate the first dental dawn of the heir of
Applebite. &ldquo;I have only to refer you,&rdquo; said uncle John,
&ldquo;to the floor of the next room for the response to my
request&mdash;namely, that you will drain your glasses; and, in the
words of nephew Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite, &lsquo;partake of
our dental delight.&rsquo;&rdquo; This eloquent address was
followed by immense cheering and a shower of sherry bottoms, which
the gentlemen in their &ldquo;entusymusy&rdquo; scattered around
them as Hesperus is reported to dispense his tee-total drops.</p>
<p>Nothing could be going on better&mdash;no woman could feel
prouder than Mrs. Waddledot, when&mdash;we hope you don&rsquo;t
anticipate the catastrophe&mdash;when two of the Argand lamps gave
olfactory demonstrations of dissolution. Sperm oil is a brilliant
illuminator, but we never knew any one except an Esquimaux, or a
Russian, who preferred it to lavender-water as a perfume. Old John
was in a muddle of misery&mdash;evidently</p>

<h2>AMERICAN CONGRESS.</h2>
<p>We hasten to lay before our readers the following authentic
reports of the latest debates in the United States&rsquo; Congress,
which have been forwarded to us by our peculiarly and especially
exclusive Reporters.</p>
<p><em>New York.</em>&mdash;The greatest possible excitement exists
here, agitating alike the bosoms of the Whites, the Browns, and the
Blacks; a universal sympathy appears to exist among all classes,
the greater portion of whom are looking exceedingly blue. The
all-absorbing question as to whether the &ldquo;war is to be or not
to be,&rdquo; seems an exceedingly difficult one to answer. One
party says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and another party says
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and a third party says the above parties
&ldquo;Lie in their teeth;&rdquo; and thereupon issue is joined,
and bowie-knives are exchanged&mdash;the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; walking
away with &ldquo;No&rsquo;s&rdquo; sheathed in the middle of his
back, and the &ldquo;No&rdquo; making up for his loss by securing
the &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;s&rdquo; somewhere between his ribs. All the
black porters are looking out for light jobs, and rushing about
with shutters and cards of address, bearing high-minded
&ldquo;Loco-focos&rdquo; and shot-down &ldquo;democrats&rdquo; to
their respective surgeons and houses. This unusual bustle and
activity gives the more political parts of the city an exceedingly
brisk appearance, and has caused most of the eminent surgeons, not
attached to either party, to be regularly retained by the principal
speakers in these most interesting debates.</p>
<p>In Congress great attention is paid to the comfort of the
various members, who are all provided with spittoons, though they
are by no means compelled to tie themselves down to the exclusive
use of those expectorant receptacles; on the contrary, much
ingenuity is shown by some of the more practised in picking out
other deposits; a vast majority of the Kentuckians will back
themselves to &ldquo;shoot through&rdquo; the opposition
member&rsquo;s nose and eye-glass without touching &ldquo;flesh or
flints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prevailing opinion appears to be, that should we come to a
fight they will completely alter the costume of the country, and
&ldquo;whop us into fits.&rdquo; Their style of elocution is
masterly in the extreme, redolent with the sagest deductions, and
overflowing with a magnificent and truly Eastern redundancy of the
most poetical tropes. I will now proceed to give you an extract
from the celebrated speaker on the war side&mdash;&ldquo;the
renowned Jonathan J. Twang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather calculate that tarnal, pisoned, alligator of a
ring-tailed, roaring, pestiferous, rattlesnake, that critter
&lsquo;the Old Country,&rsquo; would jist about give up one half
its skin, and wriggle itself slick out of the other, rayther than
go for to put our dander up at this present identical out-and-out
important critical crisis! I conceit their min&rsquo;stry have got
jist about into as considerable a tarnation nasty fix, as a naked
nigger in the stocks when the mosquitoes are steaming up a little
beyond high pressure. I guess Prince Albert and the big uns
don&rsquo;t find their seats quite as soft as buttered eels in a
mud bank! Look here&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it considerable clear
they&rsquo;re all funking like burnt Cayenne in a clay pipe; or
couldn&rsquo;t they have made a raise some how to get a ship of
their own, or borrow one, to send after that caged-up &rsquo;coon
of a Macleod? It&rsquo;s my notion, and pretty considerable clear
to me, they&rsquo;re all bounce, like bad chesnuts, very well to
look at, but come to try them at the fire for a roast, and they
turn out puff and shell. They talk of war as the boy did of
whipping his father, but like him, they daresn&rsquo;t do it, and
why not? why, for the following elegant reasons:&mdash;Since they
have been used to the advantages of doing their little retail trade
with our own go-ahead and carry-all-before-it right slick-up-an-end
double-distilled essence of a genuine fine and civilised country,
the everlasting &rsquo;possums have become habituated to some of
the manners of our enlightened inhabitants. We have nothing to do
but refuse the supply of cottons, and leave them all with as little
shirts to their backs as wool on a skinned eel. Isn&rsquo;t it the
intercourse with this here country that enables them to speak their
very language with something rayther like a leetle correctness,
though they&rsquo;re just about as far behind us as the last jint
of the sea-sarpent is from his eye-tooth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t all international law consist in keeping an
everlasting bright look-out on your own side, and jamming all other
varments slick through a stone wall, as the waggon-wheel used up
the lame frog? (Hear, hear.) I say&mdash;and mind you I&rsquo;ll
stick to it like a starved sloth to the back of a fat babby&mdash;I
say, gentlemen, this country, the United States (particularly
Kentucky, from which I come, and which will whip all the rest with
out-straws and rotten bull-rushes agin pike, bagnet, mortars, and
all their almighty fine artillery), I say, then, this country is
considerable like a genuine fac-simile of the waggon-wheel, and the
pretty oneasy busted-up old worn-out island of the bull-headed
Britishers, ain&rsquo;t nothing more than the tee-totally used-up
frog. (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect they&rsquo;d have just as much chance with us as
a muzzled monkey with a hiccory-nut. Talk of their fleet!
I&rsquo;ll bet six live niggers to a dead &rsquo;coon, our genuine
Yankee clippers will whip them into as bad a fix as a flying-fish
with a gull at his head and a shark at his tail. They&rsquo;re jist
about as much out of their reckoning as the pig that took to
swimming for his health and cut his throat trying it on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s everlasting strange to me if, to all future
posterity coming after us, the word &lsquo;Macleod&rsquo;
don&rsquo;t shut up their jaws from bragging of British valour just
about as tight as the death-squeeze of a boa-constrictor round a
smashed-up buffalo!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for the distance and leaving my
plantation, I&rsquo;d go over with any on you, and help to use up
the lot myself! Let them &lsquo;come on,&rsquo; as the tiger said
to the young kid, and see what &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do for you.&rsquo;
They talk of sending out their chaps here, do they; let them;
they&rsquo;ll be just about as happy as a toad in hot tar, and
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo; Here Jonathan J. Twang sat down amid
immense cheers; at the conclusion of which, Mr. Peter P. Pellican,
from the back-woods, requested&mdash;he, Peter P. Pellican, being
from <em>Orleans</em>&mdash;that Mr. Jonathan J. Twang would
retract certain words derogatory to the state represented by Peter
P. Pellican. Mr. Jonathan J. Twang replied in the following
determined refusal:&mdash;&ldquo;I beg to inform the last speaker,
Mr. Peter P. Pellican, from the back-woods, that I&rsquo;ll see him
tee-totatiously tarred, feathered, and physicked with red-hot oil
and fish-hooks, before I&rsquo;ll retract one eternal syllable of
my pretty particular correct assertions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement created considerable confusion. The President
behaved in the most impartial and manly manner, indiscriminately
knocking down all such of both parties who came within reach of his
mace, and not leaving the chair until he had received two black
eyes and lost two front teeth. The general
<em>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</em> was carried on with immense spirit; the
more violent members on either side pummelling each other with the
most hearty and legislative determination. This exciting scene was
continued for some time, until during a short cessation a member
with a broken leg proposed an adjournment till the following day,
when the further discussion could be carried on with Bowie-knives
and pistols; this proposition was at once acceded to with immense
delight by all parties. If well enough (as I have two broken ribs,
my share of the row) I will forward you an authentic statement of
this interesting proceeding.</p>

<h2>FIRE! FIRE!</h2>
<h3>A REMONSTRANCE WITH THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER.</h3>
<p>How melancholy an object is a &ldquo;polished front,&rdquo; that
vain-glorious and inhospitable array of cold steel and willow
shavings, in which the emancipated hearth is annually constrained
by careful housewives to signalise the return of summer, and its
own consequent degradation from being a part of the family to
become a piece of mere formal furniture. And truly in cold weather,
which (thanks to the climate, for we love our country) is all the
weather we get in England, the fire is a most important individual
in a house: one who exercises a bland authority over the tempers of
all the other inmates&mdash;for who could quarrel with his feet on
the fender? one with whom everybody is anxious to be well&mdash;for
who would fall out with its genial glow? one who submits with a
graceful resignation to the caprices of every casual
elbow&mdash;and who has never poked a fire to death? one whose good
offices have endeared him alike to the selfish and to the
cultivated,&mdash;at once a host, a mediator, and an
occupation.</p>
<p>We have often had our doubts (but then we are partial) whether
it be not possible to carry on a conversation with a fire. With the
aid of an evening newspaper by way of interpreter, and in strict
confidence, no third party being present, we feel that it can be
done. Was there an interesting debate last night? were the
ministers successful, or did the opposition carry it? In either
case, did not the fire require a vigorous poke just as you came to
the division? and did not its immediate flame, or, on the contrary,
its dull, sullen glow, give you the idea that it entertained its
own private opinions on the subject? And if those opinions seemed
contrary to yours, did you not endeavour to betray the sparks into
an untenable position, by submitting them to the gentle sophistry
of a poker nicely insinuated between the bars? or did you not
quench with a sudden retort of small coal its impertinent
congratulation at an unfortunate result? until, when its cordial
glow, penetrating that unseemly shroud, has given evidence of
self-conviction, you felt that you had dealt too harshly with an
old friend, and hastened to make it up with him again by a playful
titillation, more in jest than earnest.</p>
<p>But this is all to come. Not yet (with us) have the kindly old
bars, reverend in their attenuation, been restored to their
time-honoured throne; not yet have the dingy festoons of pink and
white paper disappeared from the garish mantel. Still desolate and
cheerless shows the noble edifice. The gaunt chimney yawns still in
sick anticipation of deferred smoke. The &ldquo;irons,&rdquo;
innocent of coal, and polished to the tip, skulk and cower
sympathetically into the extreme corner of the fender. The very rug
seems ghastly and grim, wanting the kindly play of the excited
flame. We have no comfort in the parlour yet: even the privileged
kitten, wandering in vain in search of a resting-place, deems it
but a chill dignity which has withdrawn her from the warm couch
before the kitchen-fire. Things have become too real for home. We
have no joy now in those delicious loiterings for the five minutes
before dinner&mdash;those casual snatches of Sterne, those scraps
of Steele. We have left off smiling; we are impregnable even to a
pun. What <em>is</em> the day of the month?</p>
<p>Surely were not October retrospectively associated (in April and
glorious May) with the grateful magnificence of ale, none would be
so unpopular as the chilly month. There is no period in which so
much of what ladies call &ldquo;unpleasantness&rdquo; occurs, no
season when that mysterious distemper known as
&ldquo;warming&rdquo; is so epidemic, as in October. It is a time
when, in default of being conventionally cold, every one becomes
intensely cool. A general chill pervades the domestic virtues:
hospitality is aguish, and charity becomes more than proverbially
numb.</p>
<p>In twenty days how different an appearance will things wear! The
magic circle round the hearth will be filled with beaming faces; a
score of hands will be luxuriously chafing the palpable warmth
dispensed by a social blaze; some more privileged feet may
perchance be basking in the extraordinary recesses of the fender.
We shall consult the thermometer to enjoy the cold weather by
contrast with the glowing comfort within. We shall remark how
&ldquo;time flies,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it seems only yesterday
since we had a fire before;&rdquo; forgetful of the hideous night
and the troublous dreams that have intervened since those sweet
memories. And all this&mdash;in twenty days.</p>
<p>We are no innovators: we respect all things for their age, and
some for their youth. But we would hope that, in humbly looking for
a fire in the cold weather, even though November be still in the
store of time, we should be exhibiting no dangerous propensities.
If, as we are inclined to believe, fires were discovered previously
to the invention of lord mayors, wherefore should we defer our
accession to them until he is welcomed by those frigid antiquities
Gog and Magog? Wherefore not let fires go out with the old lord
mayor, if they needs must come in with the new? Wherefore not do
without lord mayors altogether, and elect an annual grate to judge
the prisoners at the <em>bar</em> in the Mansion House, and to
listen to the quirks of the facetious Mr. <em>Hob</em>-ler?</p>
<hr />
<h3>AN APPROPRIATE GIFT.</h3>
<p>We perceive that the fair dames of Nottingham have, with
compassionate liberality, presented to Mr. Walter, one of the Tory
candidates at the late election, a silver <em>salver</em>. What a
delicate and appropriate gift for a man so beaten as Master
Walter!&mdash;the pretty dears knew where he was hurt, and applied
a silver salve&mdash;we beg pardon, <em>salver</em>&mdash;to his
wounds. We trust the remedy may prove consolatory to the poor
gentleman.</p>
<hr />
<h3>NOT A STEP FA(R)THER.</h3>
<p>The diminutive chroniclers of Animalcula-Chatter, called
small-talk, have been giving a minute description of the goings on
of His Grace of Wellington at Walmer. They hint that he sleeps and
wakes by clock-work, eats by the ounce, and drinks and walks by
measure. During the latter recreation, it is his <em>pleasure</em>,
they tell us, to use one of <em>Payne&rsquo;s</em> pedometers to
regulate his march. Thus it is quite clear the great Captain will
never become a</p>

<p>&ldquo;SOLDIER TIRED.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A MALE DUE.</h3>
<p>The Post-office in Downing-street has been besieged by various
inquirers, who are anxiously seeking for some information as to the
expected arrival of the Royal Male.</p>
<hr />
<h3>CURIOUS SYNONYMS.</h3>
<p>Sir Peter Laurie discovered during his residence in Boulogne
that <em>veau</em> is the French for <em>veal</em>. On his return
to England, being at a public dinner, he exhibited his knowledge of
the tongues by asking a brother alderman for a slice of his
<em>weal</em> or <em>woe</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>HAPPY LAND!</h3>
<p>Six young girls, inmates of the Lambeth workhouse, were brought
up at Union Hall, charged with breaking several squares of glass.
In their defence, they complained that they had been treated worse
in the workhouse than they would be in prison, and said that it was
to cause their committal to the latter place they committed the
mischief. What a beautiful picture of moral England this little
anecdote exhibits! What must be the state of society in a country
where crime is punished less severely than poverty?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Old England, bless&rsquo;d and favour&rsquo;d clime!</p>
<p class="i2">Where paupers to thy prisons run;</p>
<p>Where poverty&rsquo;s the only crime</p>
<p class="i2">That angry justice frowns upon.</p>

<h3>THE NEW STATE STRETCHER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What an uncomfortable bed Peel has made for
himself!&rdquo; observed Normanby to Palmerston.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very clear to me, I confess,&rdquo; replied
the Downing-street Cupid, &ldquo;as it is acknowledged he sleeps on
a <em>bolstered cabinet</em>.&rdquo; The pacificator of Ireland
closed his face for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>The latest case of monomania, from our own specially-raised
American correspondent:&mdash;A gentleman who fancied himself a
pendulum always went upon tick, and never discovered his delusion

<p>We perceived by a paragraph copied from the &ldquo;<em>John

of <em>seventy-six</em> feet in length, was captured a few days
since at Wick. Sir Peter Laurie and Alderman Humphrey on reading
this announcement <em>naturally</em> concluded that the

rushed off to Buckingham-palace to pay their united tribute of

<h2>THE PICTORIAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>In our last we briefly adverted to the gratifying fact that Mr.
Barry had at least a thousand superficial feet on the walls of the
new Houses of Parliament at the services of the historical painters
of England; and we also, in a passing manner, suggested a few
compositions worthy of their pencils. A reconsideration of the
matter convinces us that the subject is too important&mdash;too
national, to be adopted as merely the fringe of our article; and we
have therefore determined within ourselves to devote our present
essay to a serious discussion of the various pictures that are, or
<em>ought</em>, to decorate the interior of the new House of
Commons. As for the House of Lords, we see no necessity whatever
for lavishing the fine inspirations of art on that temple of
wisdom; inasmuch as the sages who deliberate there are, for the
most part, born legislators, coming into the world with all the
rudiments of government in embryo in their baby heads, and, on the
twenty-first anniversary of their birthday, putting their legs out
of bed adult, full-grown law-makers. It would be the height of
democratic insolence to attempt to teach these chosen few: it
would, in fact, be a misprision of treason against the sovereignty
of Nature, who, when making the <em>pia mater</em> of a future peer
of England, knows very well the delicate work she has in hand, and
takes pains accordingly. It is different when she manufactures a
mob of skulls which, by a jumble of worldly accidents, or by the
satire of Fortune in her bitterest mood, may ultimately belong to
Members of the House of Commons. These she makes, as they make
blocks in Portsmouth-yard, a hundred a minute. All she has to do is
to fulfil her contract with the world, taking care that there shall
be no want of the raw material for Members of Parliament, leaving
it to Destiny to work it up as she may. We have not the slightest
doubt, by-the-by, that poor Nature is often very much confounded by
the ultimate application of her own handiwork. We can fancy the
venerable old gossip at her business, patting up skulls as serenely
as our lamented great grandmother (she wrote a very pretty book on
the beauties of population, and illustrated the work, too, with
portraits from her own hand) was wont to pat up
apple-dumplings:&mdash;we can imagine Nature&mdash;good old
soul!&mdash;looking over her spectacles at the infant dough, and
saying to herself as she finishes skull by skull&mdash;&ldquo;Ha!
that will do for a pawnbroker;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That, as
it&rsquo;s rather low and narrow, for a sharp
attorney;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That for a parish
constable;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That for a clown at a
fair,&rdquo;&mdash;and so on. And we can well imagine the
astonishment of simple-hearted old Nature on getting a ticket for
the gallery of the House of Commons (for very seldom, indeed, has
she been known to show herself on the floor), to see her skull of a
pawnbroker on the shoulders of a Chancellor of the Exchequer; her
<em>caput</em> of the sharp attorney belonging to a Minister of the
Home Department; her head of a parish constable as a Paymaster of
the Forces; and the dough she had intended to swallow knives and
eat fire at wakes and fairs gravely responded to as &ldquo;an
honourable and gallant member!&rdquo; Whereupon, who can wonder at
the amazement and indignation of Mother Nature, and that, with a
keen sense of the misapplication of her skulls, she sometimes
abuses Mother Fortune in good set terms, mingling with her
reproaches the strongest reflections on her chastity?</p>
<p>We have thought it due to the full consideration of our subject
so far, to dwell upon the natural difference between the skull of a
Peer and the skull of a Commoner. The skull of the noble, as we
have shown, is a thing made to order&mdash;fitted up, like Mr.
MECHI&rsquo;S pocket-dressing-case, with the ornamental and useful:
no instrument can be added to it&mdash;the thing is complete.
Hence, to employ historical painters for the education of the House
of Lords would be a useless and profligate expenditure of art and
money. It would be to paint the lily LONDONDERRY&mdash;to add a
perfume to the violet ELLENBOROUGH. All Peers being from the
first&mdash;indeed, even <em>in utero</em>&mdash;ordained
law-makers, statute-making comes to them by nature. How much
history goes to prove this, showing that the House of
Lords&mdash;like the Solomons of the
<em>fleur-de-lis</em>&mdash;have learned nothing, and forgotten
nothing! To attempt to instruct a Peer would be as gross an
impertinence to the instinct of his order as to present
MINERVA&mdash;who no doubt came from the head of JOVE a Peeress in
her own right&mdash;with a toy alphabet or horn-book.</p>
<p>For the skulls of the House of Commons,&mdash;that is, indeed,
another question! We are so far utilitarian that we would have the
pictures for which Mr. BARRY offers a thousand feet selected solely
with a view to the dissemination of knowledge amongst the many
benighted members of the House of Commons. We would have the
subjects so chosen that they should entirely supersede
<em>Oldfield&rsquo;s Representative History</em>; never forgetting
the wants of the most illiterate. For instance, for the politicians
on the fifth form, the SIBTHORPS and PLUMPTRES, whose education in
their youth has been shamefully neglected, we would have a nice
pictorial political alphabet. We do not pride ourselves, be it
understood, upon writing unwrinkled verse; we only present the
subjoined as a crude idea of our plan, taken we confess, from
certain variegated volumes, to be had either of Mr. SOUTER, St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, or Messrs. DARTON and HARVEY, Holborn.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A was King ALFRED, a monarch of note;</p>
<p>B is BURDETT, who can well turn a coat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we would have the chief incidents of Alfred&rsquo;s life
nicely painted, with BURDETT, late Old Glory, and now Old
Corruption. As for the poetry, when we consider the capacities of
the learners, <em>that</em> cannot be too simple, too homely. The
House, however, may order a Committee of Versification, if it
please; all that we protest against is D&rsquo;ISRAELI being of the
number.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>C is the CORN-LAWS, that famish&rsquo;d the poor;</p>
<p>D is the DEBT, that will famish them more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, for the imaginative artist, is an opportunity! To paint
the wholesale wickedness and small villanies of the Corn-laws! What
a contrast of scene and character! Squalid hovels, and princely
residences&mdash;purse-proud, plethoric injustice, big and bloated
with, its iniquitous gains, and gaunt, famine-stricken multitudes!
Then for the Debt&mdash;that hideous thing begotten by war and
corruption; what a tremendous moral lesson might be learned from a
nightly conning of the terrific theme!</p>
<p>We have neither poetic genius nor space of paper to go through
the whole of the alphabet; we merely throw out the above four
lines&mdash;and were we not assured that they are better lines, far
more musical, than any to be found in BULWER&rsquo;S SIAMESE TWINS,
we should blush much nearer scarlet than we do&mdash;to give an
idea of the utility and beautiful comprehensiveness of our
plan.</p>
<p>The great difficulty, however, will be to compress the
subjects&mdash;so multitudinous are they&mdash;within the thousand
feet allowed by the architect. To begin with the Wittenagemot, or
meeting of the wise men, and to end with portraits of Mr.
Roebuck&rsquo;s ancestors&mdash;to say nothing of the fine
imaginative sketch of the Member for Bath tilting, in the mode of
Quixote with the steam-press of Printing-house-square&mdash;will
require the most extraordinary powers of condensation on the parts
of the artists. Nevertheless, if the undertaking be even creditably
executed, it will be a monument of national wisdom and national
utility to unborn generations of Members. What crowds of subjects
press upon us! The <em>History of Bribery</em> might make a sort of
Parliamentary Rake&rsquo;s Progress, if we could but hit upon the
artist to portray its manifold beauties. <em>The Windsor
Stables</em> and <em>the Education of the Poor</em> would form
admirable companion-pictures, in which the superiority of the horse
over the human animal could be most satisfactorily
delineated&mdash;the quadruped having considerably more than three
times the amount voted to him for snug lodging, hay, beans, and
oats, that the English pauper obtained from Parliament for that
manure of the soil&mdash;as congregated piety at Exeter Hall
denominates it&mdash;a Christian education!</p>
<p>What a beautiful arabesque border might be conceived from a
perusal of the late Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s speeches! We should
here have Parliamentary eloquence under a most fantastic yet
captivating phase. Who, for instance, but the artist to PUNCH could
paint CASTLEREAGH&rsquo;S figure of a smug, contented, selfish
traitor, the &ldquo;crocodile with his hand in his breeches&rsquo;
pocket?&rdquo; Again, does not the reader recollect that
extraordinary person who, according to the North Cray Demosthenes,
&ldquo;turned his back <em>upon himself</em>?&rdquo; There would be
a portrait!&mdash;one, too, presenting food for the most
&ldquo;sweet and bitter melancholy&rdquo; to the GRAHAMS and the
STANLEYS. There is also that immortal Parliamentary metaphor,
emanating from the same mysterious source,&mdash;&ldquo;The
<em>feature</em> upon which the question <em>hinges</em>!&rdquo;
The only man who could have properly painted this was the
enthusiastic BLAKE, who so successfully limned the ghost of a flea!
These matters, however, are to be considered as merely
supplementary ornaments to great themes. The grand subjects are to
be sought for in <em>Hansard&rsquo;s Reports</em>, in petitions
against returns of members, in the evidence that comes out in the
committee-rooms, in the abstract principles of right and wrong,
that make members honest patriots, or that make them give the
harlot &ldquo;ay&rdquo; and &ldquo;no,&rdquo; as dictated by the
foul spirit gibbering in their breeches&rsquo; pockets.</p>
<p>That we may have painted all these things, Mr. BARRY offers up
one thousand feet. Oh! Mr. B. can&rsquo;t you make it ten!</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>4.&mdash;OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRST SEASON PASSES.</h3>
<p>From the period of our last Chapter our friend commences to
adopt the attributes of the mature student. His notes are taken as
before at each lecture he attends, but the lectures are fewer, and
the notes are never fairly transcribed; at the same time they are
interspersed with a larger proportion of portraits of the lecturer,
and other humorous conceits. He proposes at lunch-time every day
that he and his companions should &ldquo;go the odd man for a
pot;&rdquo; and the determination he had formed at his entry to the
school, of working the last session for all the prizes, and going
up to the Hall on the Thursday and the College on the Friday
without grinding, appears somewhat difficult of being carried into
execution.</p>
<p>It is at this point of his studies that the student commences a
steady course of imaginary dissection: that is to say, he keeps a
chimerical account of extremities whose minute structure he has
deeply investigated (in his head), and received in return various
sums of money from home for the avowed purpose of paying for them.
If he really has put his name down for any heads and necks or
pelvic viscera at the commencement of the season, when he had
imbibed and cherished some lunatic idea &ldquo;that dissection was
the sheet-anchor of safety at the College,&rdquo; he becomes a
trafficker in human flesh, and disposes of them as quickly as he
can to any hard-working man who has his examination in
perspective.</p>
<p>He now assumes a more independent air, and even ventures to
chalk odd figures on the black board in the theatre. He has been
known, previously to the lecture, to let down the skeleton that
hangs by a balance weight from the ceiling, and, inserting its
thumb in the cavity of its nose, has there secured it with a piece
of thread, and then, placing a short pipe in its jaws, has pulled
it up again. His inventive faculties are likewise shown by various
diverting objects and allusions cut with his knife upon the ledge
before him in the lecture-room, whereon the new men rest their
note-books and the old ones go to sleep. In vain do the directors
of the school order the ledge to be coated with paint and sand
mixed together&mdash;nothing is proof against his knife; were it
adamant he would cut his name upon it. His favourite position at
lecture is now the extremity of the bench, where its horse-shoe
form places him rather out of the range of the lecturer&rsquo;s
vision; and, ten to one, it is here that he has cut a
cribbage-board on the seat, at which he and his neighbour play
during the lecture on Surgery, concealing their game from common
eyes by spreading a mackintosh cape on the desk before them. His
conversation also gradually changes its tone, and instead of mildly
inquiring of the porter, on his entering the school of a morning,
what is for the day&rsquo;s anatomical demonstration, he talks of
&ldquo;the regular lark he had last night at the Eagle, and how
jolly screwed he got!&rdquo;&mdash;a frank admission, which
bespeaks the candour of his disposition.</p>
<p>Careful statistics show us that it is about the end of November
the new man first makes the acquaintance of his uncle; and
observant people have remarked, as worthy of insertion in the
Medical Almanack amongst the usual phenomena of the
calendar&mdash;&ldquo;About this time dissecting cases and
tooth-instruments appear in the windows, and we may look for
watches towards the beginning of December.&rdquo; Although this is
his first transaction on his own account, yet his property has
before ascended the spout, when some unprincipled student, at the
beginning of the season, picked his pocket of a big silver
lancet-case, which he had brought up with him from the country; and
having, pledged it at the nearest money-lender&rsquo;s, sent him
the duplicate in a polite note, and spent the money with some other
dishonest young men, in drinking their victim&rsquo;s health in his
absence. And, by the way, it is a general rule that most new men
delight to carry big lancet-cases, although they have about as much
use for them as a lecturer upon practice of physic has for top
boots.</p>
<p>Thus gradually approaching step by step towards the perfection
of his state, the new man&rsquo;s first winter-session passes; and
it is not unlikely that, at the close of the course, he may enter
to compete for the anatomical prize, which he sometimes gets by
stealth, cribbing his answers from a tiny manual of knowledge, two
inches by one-and-a-half in size, which he hides under his
blotting-paper. This triumph achieved, he devotes the short period
which intervenes before the commencement of the summer botanical
course to various hilarious pastimes; and as the watch and
dissecting-case are both gone, he writes the following despatch to
his governor&mdash;</p>
<h4>LETTER No. II.&mdash;(<em>Copy.</em>)</h4>
<p>MY DEAR FATHER,&mdash;You will, I am sure, be delighted to learn
that I have gained the twenty-ninth honorary certificate for
proficiency in anatomy which you will allow is a very high number
when I tell you that only thirty are given. I have also the
satisfaction of informing you that the various professors have
given me certificates of having attended their lectures <em>very
diligently</em> during the past courses.</p>
<p>I work very hard, but I need not inform you that, with all my
economy, I am at some expense for good books and instruments. I
have purchased <em>Liston&rsquo;s Surgery</em>, Anthony
Thompson&rsquo;s <em>Materia Medica</em>, Burns and
Merriman&rsquo;s <em>Midwifery</em>, Graham&rsquo;s
<em>Chemistry</em>, Astley Cooper&rsquo;s <em>Dislocations</em>,
and Quain&rsquo;s <em>Anatomy</em>, all of which I have read
carefully through twice. I also pay a private demonstrator to go
over the bones with me of a night; and I have bought a skeleton at
Alexander&rsquo;s&mdash;a great bargain. This, when I
&ldquo;pass,&rdquo; I think of presenting to the museum of the
hospital, as I am under great obligations to the surgeons. I think
a ten-pound note willl clear my expenses, although I wish to enter
to a summer course of dissections, and take some lessons in
practical chemistry in the laboratories with Professor Carbon, but
these I will endeavour to pay for out of my own pocket. With my
best regards to all at home, believe me,</p>
<p class="rgt">Your affectionate son,<br />
JOSEPH MUFF.</p>
<p>As soon as the summer course begins, the Botanical Lectures
commence with it, and the polite Company of Apothecaries
courteously request the student&rsquo;s acceptance of a ticket of
admission to the lectures, at their garden at Chelsea. As these
commence somewhere about eight in the morning, of course he must
get up in the middle of the night to be there; and consequently he
attends very often, of course. But the botanical excursions that
take place every Saturday from his own school are his especial
delight. He buys a candle-box to contain all the chickweed,
chamomiles, and dandelions he may collect, and slinging it over his
shoulder with his pocket-handkerchief, he starts off in company
with the Professor and his fellow-herbalists to Wandsworth Common,
Battersea Fields, Hampstead Heath, or any other favourite spot
which the cockney Flora embellishes with her offspring.</p>
<p>The conduct of medical students on botanical excursions
generally appears in various phases. Some real lovers of the study,
pale men in spectacles, who wear shoes and can walk for ever,
collect every weed they drop upon, to which they assign a most
extraordinary name, and display it at their lodgings upon cartridge
paper, with penny pieces to keep the leaves in their places as they
dry. Others limit their collections to stinging-nettles, which they
slyly insert into their companions&rsquo; pockets, or long
bulrushes, which they tuck under the collars of their coats; and
the remainder turn into the first house of public entertainment
they arrive at on emerging from the smoke of London to the rural
districts, and remain all day absorbed in the mysteries of ground
billiards and knock-&lsquo;em-downs, their principal vegetable
studies being confined to lettuces, spring onions, and
water-cresses. But all this is very proper&mdash;we mean the
botanical part of the story&mdash;for the knowledge of the natural
class and order of a buttercup must be of the greatest service to a
practitioner in after-life in treating a case of typhus fever or
ruptured blood-vessel. At some of the Continental Hospitals, the
pupil&rsquo;s time is wasted at the bedside of the patient, from
which he can only get practical information. How much better is the
primrose-investigating <em>curriculum</em> of study observed at our
own medical schools!</p>
<hr />
<h3>SOME THINGS TO WHICH THE IRISH WOULD NOT SWEAR.</h3>
<p>MR. GROVE.&mdash;This insufferably ignorant, and, therefore,
insolent magisterial cur, who has recently made himself an object
of unenviable notoriety, by asserting that &ldquo;the Irish would
swear anything,&rdquo; has shown himself to be as stupid as he is
malignant. Would, for instance, the most hard-mouthed Irishman in
existence venture to swear that&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Grove is a gentleman; or that&mdash;</li>
<li>Sir Francis Burdett has brought honour to his grey hairs; or
that&mdash;</li>
<li>Colonel Sibthorp has more brains than beard; or
that&mdash;</li>
<li>Sir Robert Peel feels for anybody but himself; or
that&mdash;</li>
<li>Peter Borthwick was listened to with attention; or
that&mdash;</li>
<li>Sir Peter Laurie&rsquo;s wisdom cannot be estimated; or
that&mdash;</li>
<li>Sir Edward George Erle Lytton Bulwer thinks very small beer of
himself; or that&mdash;</li>
<li>The Earl of Coventry carries a vast deal of sense under his
hat; or that&mdash;</li>
<li>Mr. Roebuck is the pet of the <em>Times</em>; or, in short,
that&mdash;</li>
<li>The Tories are the best and most popular governors that England
ever had.</li>
</ul>
<p>If &ldquo;the Irish would swear&rdquo; to the above, we confess
they &ldquo;would swear anything.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>HOSTILITIES IN PRIVATE LIFE.</h2>
<p>We have just heard of an event which has shaken the peace of a
highly respectable house in St. Martin&rsquo;s Court, from the
chimney-pots to the coal-cellar. Mrs. Brown, the occupier of the
first floor, happened, on last Sunday, to borrow of Mrs. Smith, who
lived a pair higher in the world, a German silver teapot, on the
occasion of her giving a small twankey party to a few select
friends. But though she availed herself of Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s
German-silver, to add respectability to her <em>soir&eacute;e</em>,
she wholly overlooked Mrs. Smith, who was <em>not</em> invited to
partake of the festivities. This was a slight that no woman of
spirit could endure; and though Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s teapot was
German-silver, she resolved to let Mrs. Brown see that she had
herself some real Britannia <em>mettle</em> in her composition.
Accordingly when the teapot was sent up the following morning to
Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s apartments, with Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s
&ldquo;compliments and thanks,&rdquo; Mrs. Smith discovered or
affected to discover, a serious contusion on the lid of the
article, and despatched it by her own servant back to Mrs. Brown,
accompanied by the subjoined note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s compliments to Mrs. Brown, begs to
return the teapott to the latter&mdash;in consequence of the
ill-usage it has received in her hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Brown, being a woman who piques herself upon her talent at
epistolary writing, immediately replied in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s compliments to Mrs. Smith, begs to say
that her paltry teapot received no ill usage from Mrs.
Brown.&mdash;Mrs. B. will thank Mrs. S. not to put two
<em>t</em>&rsquo;s at the end of <em>teapot</em> in
future.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note and the teapot were forthwith sent upstairs to Mrs.
Smith, whose indignation being very naturally roused, she again
returned the battered affair, with this spirited
missive:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Smith begs to inform Mrs. Brown, that she despises
her insinuations, and to say, that she will put as many
<em>t</em>&rsquo;s as she pleases in her <em>teapot</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Mrs. S. expects to be paid 10<em>s</em>. for
the injured article.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the teapot was sent upstairs, with the following reply
from Mrs. Brown:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brown thinks Mrs. Smith a low creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Mrs. B. won&rsquo;t pay a farthing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correspondence terminated here, the German-silver teapot
remaining in <em>statu quo</em> on the lobby window, between the
territories of the hostile powers; and there it might have remained
until the present moment, if Mrs. Brown had not declared, in an
audible voice, at the foot of the stairs, that Mrs. Smith was
acting under the influence of gin, which reaching the ears of the
calumniated lady, she rushed down to the landing-place, and seizing
the teapot, discharged it at Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s head, which it
fortunately missed, but totally annihilated a plaster figure of
Napoleon, which stood in the hall, and materially damaged its own
spout. Mrs. Brown, being wholly unsupported at the time, retired
hastily within the defences of her own apartments, which Mrs. Smith
cannonaded vigorously for upwards of ten minutes with a broom
handle; and there is every reason to believe she would shortly have
effected a practicable breach, if a reinforcement from the kitchen
had not arrived to aid the besieged, and forced the assailant back
to her second-floor entrenchments. Mrs. Smith then demanded a truce
until evening, which was granted by Mrs. Brown; notwithstanding
which the former lady was detected, in defiance of this
arrangement, endeavouring to <em>blow up</em> Mrs. Brown through
the keyhole.</p>
<p>There is no telling how this unhappy difference will terminate;
for though at present matters appear tolerably quiet, we know not
(as in the case of the Canadas) at what moment we may have to
inform our readers that</p>

<h2>GEOLOGY OF SOCIETY.</h2>
<h3>SECTION II.</h3>
<p>We last week described the different strata of society
comprehended in the INFERIOR SERIES, and the lower portion of the
<em>Clapham Group</em>. We now beg to call the attention of our
readers to a most important division in the next great
formation&mdash;which has been termed the TRANSITION
CLASS&mdash;because the individuals composing it are in a gradual
state of elevation, and have a tendency to mix with the superior
strata. By referring to the scale which we gave in our first
section, it will be seen that the lowest layer in this class is
formed by the people who keep shops and one-horse
&ldquo;shays,&rdquo; and go to Ramsgate for three weeks in the
dog-days. They all exhibit evidences of having been thrown up from
a low to a high level. The elevating causes are numerous, but the
most remarkable are those which arise from the action of unexpected
legacies. Lotteries were formerly the cause of remarkable
elevations; and speculation in the funds may be still considered as
amongst the elevating causes, though their effect is frequently to
cause a sudden sinking. Lying immediately above the &ldquo;shop and
shay&rdquo; people, we find the old substantial merchant, who every
day precisely as the clock strikes ten is in the act of hanging up
his hat in his little back counting-house in Fenchurch-street. His
private house, however, is at Brixton-hill, where the gentility of
the family is supported by his wife, two daughters, a piano, and a
servant in livery. The best and finest specimens of this strata are
susceptible of a slight polish; they are found very useful in the
construction of joint stock banks, railroads, and other
speculations where a good foundation is required. We now come to
the <em>Russell-square group</em>, which comprehends all those
people who &ldquo;live private,&rdquo; and aim at being thought
fashionable and independent. Many individuals of this group are
nevertheless supposed by many to be privately connected with some
trading concern in the City. It is a distinguishing characteristic
of the second layer in this group to have a tendency to give
dinners to the superior series, while the specimens of the upper
stratum are always found in close proximity to a carriage. Family
descent, which is a marked peculiarity of the SUPERIOR CLASS, is
rarely to be met with in the <em>Russell-square group</em>. The
fossil animals which exist in this group are not numerous: they are
for the most part decayed barristers and superannuated doctors. Of
the ST. JAMES&rsquo;S SERIES it is sufficient to say that it
consists of four strata, of which the superior specimens are
usually found attached to coronets. Most of the precious stones, as
diamonds, rubies, emeralds, are also to be found in this layer. The
materials of which it is composed are various, and appear
originally to have belonged to the inferior classes; and the only
use to which it can be applied is in the construction of
<em>peers</em>. Throughout all the classes there occur what are
called <em>veins</em>, containing diverse substances. The
<em>larking vein</em> is extremely abundant in the superior
classes&mdash;it is rich in brass knockers, bell handles, and
policemen&rsquo;s rattles; this vein descends through all the lower
strata, the specimens in each differing according to the situation
in which they are found; the middle classes being generally
discovered deposited in the Coal-hole Tavern or the Cider-cellars,
while the individuals of the very inferior order are usually
discovered in gin-shops and low pot-houses, and not
unfrequently</p>

<p>Father Thames, not content with his customary course, has been
&ldquo;swelling it&rdquo; in the course of the week, through some
of the streets of the metropolis. As if to inculcate temperance, he
walked himself down into public-house cellars, filling all the
empty casks with water, and adulterating all the beer and spirits
that came in his way; turning also every body&rsquo;s fixed into
floating capital. Half empty butts, whose place was below, came
sailing up into the bar through the ceiling of the cellar;
saucepans were elevated from beneath the dresser to the dresser
itself; while cups were made &ldquo;to pop off the hooks&rdquo;
with surprising rapidity.</p>
<p>But the greatest consternation that prevailed was among the
<em>rats</em>, particularly those in the neighbourhood of
Downing-street, who were driven out of the sewers they inhabit with
astounding violence.</p>
<p>The dairies on the banks of the Thames were obliged to lay aside
their customary practice of inundating the milk; for such a
&ldquo;meeting of the waters&rdquo; as would otherwise have ensued
must have proved rather too much, even for the regular
customers.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.&mdash;No. V.</h2>
<h3>NATURAL HISTORY (<em>Continued</em>).</h3>
<h4>THE OPERA-DANCER (<em>H. capernicus</em>&mdash;CERITOE).</h4>
<p>So decidedly does this animal belong to the Bimana order of
beings, that to his two legs he is indebted for existence. Most of
his fellow bipeds live by the work of their hands, except indeed
the feathered and tailor tribes, who live by their bills; but from
his thighs, calves, ancles, and toes, does the opera-dancer derive
subsistence for the less important portions of his anatomy.</p>
<p><em>Physiology.</em>&mdash;The body, face, and arms of the
opera-dancer present no peculiarities above the rest of his
species; and it is to his lower extremities alone that we must look
for distinguishing features. As our researches extend downwards
from head to foot, the first thing that strikes us is a
protuberance of the ante-occipital membranes, so great as to
present a back view that describes two sides of a scalene triangle,
the apex of which projects posteriorly nearly half way down the
figure. That a due equilibrium may be preserved in this difficult
position (technically called &ldquo;the first&rdquo;), the toes are
turned out so as to form a right angle with the lower leg. Thus, in
walking, this curious being presents a mass of animated straight
lines that have an equal variety of inclination to a bundle of rods
carelessly tied up, or to Signor Paganini when afflicted with the
lumbago.</p>
<p><em>Habits.</em>&mdash;The habits of the opera-dancer vary
according as we see him in public or in private life. On the stage
he is all spangles and activity; off the stage, seediness and
decrepitude are his chief characteristics. It is usual for him to
enter upon his public career with a tremendous bound and a hat and
feathers. After standing upon one toe, he raises its fellow up to a
line with his nose, and turns round until the applause comes, even
if that be delayed for several minutes. He then cuts six, and
shuffles up to a female of his species, who being his sweetheart
(in the ballet), has been looking savage envy at him and spiteful
indignation at the audience on account of the applause, which ought
to have been reserved for her own capering&mdash;to come. When it
does, she throws up her arms and steps upon tiptoe about three
paces, looking exactly like a crane with a sore heel. Making her
legs into a pair of compasses, she describes a circle in the air
with one great toe upon a pivot formed with the other; then bending
down so that her very short petticoat makes a &ldquo;cheese&rdquo;
upon the ground, spreads out both arms to the <em>rou&eacute;s</em>
in the stalls, who understand the signal, and cry &ldquo;<em>Brava!
brava!!</em>&rdquo; Rising, she turns her back to display her gauze
<em>jupe &eacute;lastique</em>, which is always exceedingly
<em>bouffante</em>: expectorating upon the stage as she retires.
She thus makes way for her lover, who, being her professional
rival, she invariably detests.</p>
<p>It is singular that in private life the habits of the animal
differ most materially according to its sex. The male sometimes
keeps an academy and a kit fiddle, but the domestic relations of
the female remain a profound mystery; and although Professors Tom
Duncombe, Count D&rsquo;Orsay, Chesterfield, and several other
eminent Italian-operatic natural historians, have spent immense
fortunes in an ardent pursuit of knowledge in this branch of
science, they have as yet afforded the world but a small modicum of
information. Perhaps what they <em>have</em> learned is not of a
nature to be made public.</p>
<p><em>Moral Characteristics.</em>&mdash;None.</p>
<p><em>Reproduction.</em>&mdash;The offspring of opera-dancers are
not, as is sometimes supposed, born with wings; the truth is that
these cherubim are frequently attached by their backs to copper
wires, and made to represent flying angels in fairy dramas; and
those appendages, so far from being natural, are supplied by the
property-man, together with the wreaths of artificial flowers which
each Liliputian divinity upholds.</p>
<p><em>Sustenance.</em>&mdash;All opera-dancers are decidedly
omnivorous. Their appetite is immense; quantity and (for most of
them come from France), not quality, is what they chiefly desire.
When not dining at their own expense, they eat all they can, and
pocket the rest. Indeed, a celebrated sylphide&mdash;unsurpassed
for the graceful airiness of her evolutions&mdash;has been known to
make the sunflower in the last scene bend with the additional
weight of a roast pig, an apple pie, and sixteen <em>omelettes
souffl&eacute;es</em>&mdash;drink, including porter, in proportion.
Various philosophers have endeavoured to account for this
extraordinary digestive capacity; but some of their arguments are
unworthy of the science they otherwise adorn. For example, it has
been said that the great exertions to which the dancer is subject
demand a corresponding amount of nutriment, and that the copious
transudation superinduced thereby requires proportionate supplies
of suction; while, in point of fact, if such theorists had studied
their subject a little closer, they would have found these
unbounded appetites accounted for upon the most simple and
conclusive ground: it is clear that, as most opera-dancers&rsquo;
lives are passed in a <em>pirouette</em>, they must naturally have
enormous twists!</p>
<p><em>The geographical distribution of opera-dancers</em> is
extremely well defined, as their names implies; for they most do
congregate wherever an opera-house exists. Some, however, descend
to the non-lyric drama, and condescend to &ldquo;illustrate&rdquo;
the plays of Shakespeare. It is said that the classical manager of
Drury Lane Theatre has secured a company of them to help the
singers he has engaged to perform Richard the Third, Coriolanus,
and other historical plays.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why has a clock always a bashful appearance?&mdash;Because it
always keeps its hands before its face.</p>
<hr />
<h3>KIDNAPPING EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>
<p>The <em>Chronicle</em> has been making a desperate attempt to
come out in Punch&rsquo;s line; he has absolutely been trying the
&ldquo;Too-too-tooit&mdash;tooit;&rdquo; but has made a most
melancholy failure of it. We could forgive him his efforts to be
facetious (though we doubt that his readers will) if he had not
kidnapped three of our own particular pets&mdash;the very men who
lived and grew in the world&rsquo;s estimation on our wits; we mean
Peter Borthwick, Ben D&rsquo;Israeli, and our own immortal
Sibthorp. Of poor Sib. the joker of the <em>Chronicle</em> says in
last Tuesday&rsquo;s paper&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We regret to hear that Col. Sibthorp has suffered
severely by cutting himself in the act of shaving. His friends,
however, will rejoice to learn that his whiskers have escaped, and
that he himself is going on favourably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We spent an entire night in endeavouring to discover where the
wit lay in this <em>cutting</em> paragraph; but were obliged at
last to give it up, convinced that we might as well have made</p>

<h3>A PAIR OF DUCKS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, Sir Peter,&rdquo; said a brother Alderman to the
City Laurie-ate the other day, while discussing the merits of
Galloway&rsquo;s plan for a viaduct from Holborn-hill to
Skinner-street, &ldquo;Pray, Sir Peter, can you inform me what is
the difference between a viaduct and an aqueduct?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied our &ldquo;City
Correspondent,&rdquo; with amazing condescension; &ldquo;a
<em>via-duck</em> is a land-duck, and an <em>aqua-duck</em> is a
water-duck!&rdquo; The querist confessed he had no idea before of
the immensity of Sir Peter&rsquo;s scientific knowledge.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>MARGARET MAYFIELD; OR, THE MURDER OF THE LONE FARM-HOUSE.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/015-12.png"><img src=
"images/015-12.png" alt=
"A couple next to a flowery tree form a letter P." id="img015-12"
name="img015-12" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">P</span>rodigious! The minor drama has
exhausted its stock of major crimes: parricide is out of date;
infanticide has become from constant occurrence decidedly low;
homicide grows tame and uninteresting; and fratricide is a mere
bagatelle, not worthy of attention. The dramatist must therefore
awaken new sympathies by contriving new crimes&mdash;he must
invent. In this the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells genius has been fortunate.
He has brought forward a novelty in assassination, which is
harrowing in the extreme: it may be called
<em>Farm-house-icide</em>! Just conceive the pitch of intense
sympathy it is possible for one to feel, while beholding &ldquo;the
<em>murder</em> of a lone farm-house!&rdquo; Arson is nothing to
it.</p>
<p>Out of this novel domiciliary catastrophe the author of
&ldquo;Margaret Mayfield&rdquo; has formed a melodrama, which in
every other respect is founded, like a chancellor&rsquo;s decree,
upon precedent; it being a good old-fashioned, cut-throat piece, of
the leather-breeches-and-gaiter, plough-and-pitchfork school. A
country-inn parlour of course commences the story, where certain
characters assemble, who reveal enough of themselves and of the
characters assumed by their fellows (at that time amusing
themselves in the green-room), to let any person the least
acquainted with the literature of melodrama into the secret of the
entire plot. There is the villain, who is as usual in love with the
heroine, and in league with three ill-looking fellows sitting at a
separate table. There too is the old-established farmer, who has
about him a considerable sum of money&mdash;a fact he mentions for
the information of his pot-companions, on purpose to be robbed of
it. The low comedian as usual disports himself upon a three-legged
stool, dressed in the never-to-be-worn-out short
<em>non</em>-continuations, skirtless coat, and
&ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; tile.</p>
<p>A scene or two afterwards, and we are surprised to find that the
farmer is safely housed, and that he has not been robbed upon a
bleak moor on a dark stage. But we soon feel a sensation of awe,
when we learn that before us is the interior of the very farm-house
that is going to be murdered. The farmer and his wife go through
the long-standing dialogue of stage-stereotype, about love and
virtue, the price of turnips, and their only child; and the husband
goes to some fair with a friend, who had just been rejected by his
sister-in-law in favour of the villain. The coast being left clear,
the villain and his accomplices enter, and we know something
dreadful is going to happen, for the farmer&rsquo;s wife is gone
out of the way on purpose not to interrupt. The villain draws a
knife and drags his sweetheart into an out-house, and then the wife
comes on to describe what is passing; for the audiences of
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells would tear up the benches if they dared to
murder out of sight, without being told what is going on.
Accordingly, we hear a scream, and the sister of the screamer
exclaims,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, horror! He draws the knife across her
throat! (Great applause.) But no; she takes up a broken ploughshare
and escapes! (A slight tendency to hiss.) Now he seizes her hair,
he throws her down. Ah! see how the blood streams from
her&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; (Intense delight as the woman falls flat
upon the boards, supposed to be overcome with dread.) A bloody
knife, of course, next enters, grasped by the villain; who, as
usual, remarks he is sorry for what has happened, but it
can&rsquo;t be helped, and must be made the best of. The woman
having suddenly recovered, escapes into an additional private box,
or trunk, placed on the stage for that purpose; stating that she
will see what is going on from between the cracks. The villain then
murders the child, and walks off with his hands in his pocket;
leaving, as is always the case, the fatal knife in a most
conspicuous part of the stage, which for some seconds it has all to
itself. The farmer comes in, takes up the knife, and falls down in
a fit, just in time for the constables to come in and to take him
up for the murder. The wife jumps out of the box, and by her
assistance a tableau is formed for the act-drop to fall to.</p>
<p>Our readers, of course, guess the rest. The farmer is condemned
to be hanged; and in the last scene he is one of the never-omitted
procession to the gallows. At the cue, &ldquo;Now then, I am ready
to meet my fate like a man,&rdquo; the screech in that case always
made and provided is heard at a distance. &ldquo;Hold! hold! he is
innocent!&rdquo; are the next words; and enter the wife with a pair
of pistols, and a witness. The executioner pardons the condemned on
his own responsibility; and the villain comes on, on purpose to be
shot, which is done by the farmer, who seems determined not to be
accused of murder for nothing.</p>
<p>To these charming series of murders we may add that of the
Queen&rsquo;s English, which was shockingly maltreated, without the
least remorse or mitigation.</p>

<h3>THE TWO LAST IMPORTANT SITTINGS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Ross has had the last sitting of the Princess Royal for her
portrait, and the Tories the last sitting of Mr. Walter for
Nottingham.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SIBTHORPIAN PROBLEMS.</h3>
<p>Colonel Sibthorp presents his compliments to his dear friend and
fellow, PUNCH, and seeing in the <em>Times</em> of Wednesday last a
long account of the extraordinary arithmetical powers of a new
calculating machine, invented by Mr. Wertheimber, he is desirous of
asking the inventor, through the ubiquitous pages of PUNCH, whether
his, Mr. W.&rsquo;s apparatus&mdash;which, as his friend George
Robins would say, is a lot which seems to be worthy only of the
great Bidder&mdash;(he thinks he had him there)&mdash;whether this
automatical American, or steam calculator, could solve for him the
following queries:&mdash;</p>
<p>If the House of Commons be divided by Colonel Sibthorp on the
Corn Laws, how much will it add to his credit?</p>
<p>How many times will a joke of Colonel Sibthorp&rsquo;s go into
the London newspapers?</p>
<p>Extract the root of Mr. Roebuck&rsquo;s family tree, and say
whether it would come out in anything but vulgar fractions.</p>
<p>Required the difference between political and imperial measures,
and state whether the former belong to dry or superficial.</p>
<p>If thirty-six be six square, what is St.
James&rsquo;s-square?&mdash;and if the first circles be resident
there, say whether this may not be considered as an approximation
to the quadrature of the circle.</p>
<p>State the <em>contents</em> of the House of Commons upon the
next motion of Sir Robert Peel, and whether the malcontents will be
greater or less.</p>
<p>Required the capacities in feet between a biped, a quadruped,
and a centipede, and say whether the foot of Mr. Joseph Hume, being
just as broad as it is long, may not be considered as a square
foot.</p>
<p>Express, in harmonious numbers, the proportion between the rhyme
and the reason of Mr. Benjamin D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s
revolutionary epic, and say whether this is not a question of
<em>inverse</em> ratio.</p>
<p>Whether, in political progression, the two extremes, Duke of
Newcastle and Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, are equal to the mean Joseph
Hume.</p>
<p>Is it possible to multiply the difficulties of the Whigs, and,
if so, am I the figure for the part?</p>
<p>What is the difference between the squares of Messrs. Tom Spring
and John Gully, and whether the one is the fourth, fifth, or what
power of the other?</p>
<hr />
<h3>A SLAP AT JOHN CHINAMAN&rsquo;S CHOPS.</h3>
<p>Peter Borthwick lately arrived at the highest possible pressure
of indignation, while reading some of the insolent fulminations
from the Celestial Empire. But Peter was sorely at a loss to
account for their singular names: he was instantly enlightened by
the Finsbury interpreter, our Tom Duncombe, who rendered the matter
clear by asserting it was because the Emperor was very partial to

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
